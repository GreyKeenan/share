========================================

For freshmen applicants,
scholarship application is part of the application process.
For transfer students, its specific to their college of choice.

There are college-wide scholarships listed.
Not sure if you can apply to those as a transfer student.

For CSE, its part of the transfer application as well.
They consider extracurricular activities.
